    "description": "Water stress measures the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total available annual renewable supply, accounting for upstream consumptive use. Higher values indicate more competition among users. / Interannual variability measures the variability in water supply from year to year. / Seasonal variability measures the variation in water supply between months of the year. / Drought severity estimates the average of the length times the dryness of droughts from 1901 to 2008. Drought is defined as a continuous period where soil moisture remains below the 20th percentile, length is measured in months, and dryness is the number of percentage points below the 20th percentile. / Groundwater stress measures the relative ratio of groundwater withdrawal to recharge rate. Values above one indicate where unsustainable groundwater consumption could affect groundwater availability and groundwater-dependent ecosystems.",
